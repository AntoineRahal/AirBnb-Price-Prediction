# AirBnb Listings Price Prediction

## Overview

Airbnb is a marketplace for short term rentals, allowing you to list part or all your living space for others to rent. The company itself has grown rapidly from its founding in 2008 to a 30-billion-dollar valuation in 2016 and is currently worth more than any hotel chain in the world. One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type, and more. Since Airbnb is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace.
If the host charges above the market price, then renters will select other affordable alternatives. If the nightly rent price is set too low, the hosts will miss out on potential revenue. So, we use machine learning models to predict the optimal prices that the hosts can set for their properties. This is done by comparing the property with other listings on a variety of parameters like location, property size and other demographics. Also, based on the listing specifications and prices, the hosts would like to know what review rating they can expect or weigh how their listing compares to other similar ones and if they have a price premium with respect to other similar listings or are losing out on rating because of their pricing.

## Data & Methods

In this project, we perform EDA, Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning and use several models to predict the prices of Airbnb listing on the public London Airbnb dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/labdmitriy/airbnb). The listings.csv file was used for this project.
